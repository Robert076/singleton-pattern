# ðŸ§© singleton-pattern
Practicing the singleton design pattern. Contains a useful example about the singleton design pattern written in python.

When you need a single instance of something, the singleton pattern is the way to go. I personally don't like it since it's hard to test but it's still a pattern after all.
